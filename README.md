## Introduction
NOTE: This document is work in progress and not ready for usage yet. 
This document provides instructions on how to develop your first Brandchat Bot using NodeJS.

## Prerequisits
In order to develop and run a Bot on Brandchat, you need these three things: 
-	A valid Brandchat Account (see how to [sign up for Brandchat](https://www.brandchat.co/brands)).
-	Create a new Bot Agent (Under 'Agents' menu of your Brand Administration console) (TODO: See how to create new bot agent)
-	Download and Install NodeJS onto your target environment ([see how to install and setup NodeJS on your environment](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/))


## Your first Brandchat Bot
To start your first bot, assuming you already completed above steps, you can download this startup template into your local working directory using

'git clone https://github.com/almircajic/brandchat-startup-bot.git'

This will create folder **brandchat-startup-bot** and inside it a few files.
